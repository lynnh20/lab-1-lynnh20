```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
data = read.csv("gapminder-5060.csv")
```

```{r}
rel = data %>% filter(country == "China" | country == "Guatemala" | country == "Morocco")
rel %>% ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = country)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Life Expectancy vs GDP per Capita")
```
In China, Guatemala, and Morocco, life expectancy increases as GDP per capita increases. Morocco had a year where their life expectancy and GDP didn't follow the expected trends. 

Tips to make github easier to use:
1. Learn the syntax (like how to make a table)
2. Talk to your collaborators
3. Learn less obvious features like insights
